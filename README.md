## Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you install the prerequisites to attend the MLSA Deep Learing Tutorial smoothly. Majority of this section is a self-task which shall not be covered during the session. If you have any doubts, feel free to contact any of the mentors for the session. Happy Deep Learning!

[^1] : Acronym for Exploratory Data Analysis. In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling and thereby contrasts traditional hypothesis testing.
