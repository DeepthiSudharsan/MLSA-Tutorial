## Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you install the prerequisites to attend the MLSA Deep Learing Tutorial smoothly. Majority of this section is a self-task which shall not be covered during the session. If you have any doubts, feel free to contact any of the mentors for the session. Happy Deep Learning!

### Python
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.
<details><summary><b>Installation</b></summary>

1. Check whether you already have an up to date version of Python installed by entering `python` in a command line window. If you see a response from a Python interpreter it will include a version number in its initial display. For this tutorial, you need Python3 installed, which is displayed as `3.x`. This is important for the Tensorflow library to work properly. On Windows, try `py` first - this is the relatively recent Python Launcher, which has a better chance of avoiding some of the path problems that might occur because on Windows programs don't install into any of the small set of common locations that are searched by default.

2. If Python is not installed, go to the [Python Windows Download Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and download the appropriate version for your system. For this tutorial, we shall be using [Python 3.10.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3107/). According to your CPU architecture, you can install Python using the [32-bit Installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.7/python-3.10.7.exe) or [64-bit Installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.7/python-3.10.7-amd64.exe).

3. Verify the installation of Python and pip by running `python` command and `pip -V` on your command prompt/powershell.

### Microsoft VS Code
Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET).
<details><summary><b>Installation</b></summary>

1. Download the [Visual Studio Code installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534107) for Windows.

2. Once it is downloaded, run the installer (VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe). This will only take a minute.

3. By default, VS Code is installed under `C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code`.

</details>


<details><summary><b>Alternate Installation Method</b></summary>

1. Download the [Visual Studio Code Zip Archive](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=winzip).

2. Once it is downloaded, extract the archive to your desired location.

3. Add Visual Studio Code to your `%PATH%` by adding the Microsoft Visual Studio Code `bin` path to your `System Variables` in Environment Variables.

You can access more resources for getting started and customizing preferences on the [Visual Studio Code Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) section.

### Microsoft Power BI
Power BI is an interactive data visualization software product developed by Microsoft with a primary focus on business intelligence. It is part of the Microsoft Power Platform. Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Data may be input by reading directly from a database, webpage, or structured files such as spreadsheets, CSV, XML, and JSON.
<details><summary><b>Installation</b></summary>

1. Download the [Power BI installer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494) for Windows.

2. Once it is downloaded, run the downloaded installer. Select the installation folder and install. This will only take a minute.

### Streamlit
Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc. With Streamlit, no callbacks are needed since widgets are treated as variables. Data caching simplifies and speeds up computation pipelines. Streamlit watches for changes on updates of the linked Git repository and the application will be deployed automatically in the shared link.<br><br>
<b>Installation</b><br>
Please refer the [official Streamlit Installation Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation) for installing streamlit on Windows.


### Tensorflow 2
TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.<br><br>
<b>Installation</b><br>
For installation instructions through `pip`, refer to the [Official Tensorflow2 Installation Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip).
